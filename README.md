<b>Thoughts about the pre-task</b>

I liked doing the tasks that were given in the pre-task. I had some trouble remembering the syntax, but I'm fortunate that there is so much documentation available to check out. Also, doing the tests using react testing library was something that I've done only once previously and it took me some time to remind myself, how it works. 

What I wish I had more time to do in the task:
-  getting a boolean to the complete/incomplete button
-  making the app complete so it doesn't break when there are to-dos that flow over the vh of the page.
-  saving the tasks in LocalStorage for later use

I just ran out of time on figuring the two first of those out and the third would have been a nice bonus.

This app is intended as a React pre-task for applying to Buutti as a developer.

<b>Tasks:</b>

1. Refactor this app with the following criterion:

-   Use only functional components
-   Give it a good architectural structure
-   Change the UI look to something better. You choose the style.

2. Write unittests to test 1 component well.

<b>To return:</b>

-   Fork this repo to your own github, gitlab or bitbucket account and send the interviewer the link to that repo.
